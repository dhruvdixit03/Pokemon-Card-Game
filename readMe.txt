This Project is a Pokemon Trading Card Game.

It allows you to play against either an easy or hard AI and attempt to take the number 1 spot on the leaderboard.

To run, download the zip file and keep all of its contents together. Drag that file into an editor like vscode and make sure to correctly import all the modules. Otherwise the game will not work. Then simply run the code and the game will start.

I am using the libraries: random, time, math, os, decimal, cmu_112_graphics, pygame, and ast.
